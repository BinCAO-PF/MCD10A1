More importantly, the script also generates a derived snow phenology product where I calculate the date of snow melt (< 5% snow cover) in spring and and snow accumulation (> 5%) in autumn.\r\n\r\nAs an example the script runs a simple regression analysis to mark trends in snow melt dates, answering the question if snow melt occurs later or earlier over time.\r\n\r\n## Use\r\nYou can clone the project, copy and paste the code into your current workspace / project or use the [GEE link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/bd06f9efa757b7fbf9d2ae282d319282).\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nBelow you see a snow melt trend map of the US and Canada, with earlier snow melt marked in red and later snow melt marked in blue. \r\n\r\nSome clear trends can be seen in the mountain ranges in the West of the US with very pronounced earlier snow melt dates. High latitudes throughout Alaska and Canada also see a shorter snow season. Some later snow melt date trends can be noted as well, sweeping east from the middle of Alberta, Canada, to the great lakes.\r\n\r\nCaution is needed in interpreting the trend analysis as generated by the code. The analysis relies on a simple linear regression which might be skewed by outliers. I suggest using a panel analysis or a robust regression analysis before making any scientific inference.\r\n\r\n![](snowmelt_trends.png)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge my code by citing the github release through it's DOI.\r\n",
